## How to access the test page
Please follow the below format otherwise the errror message will be displayed.
[(root) directory]index.php?product=classic-tee

## Please take note of that:
1. I overran the 5-hour time limit simply because I didn't want to stop this fun process. The estimated time spent is 7-8 hours, for which I will willingly accept any point reduction.
2. I used Javascript "Arrow Notation" which does not work for the old platforms such as iOS 9.
3. As I didn't have time to set up a database for this project, I used a PHP (abstract) class as an alternative (please see Product_Catalog class in classes.php).
4. It's a single page website, any base stylesheets were used (no @import rules).


```
<script>
    var test = 12;
    console.log(test);
</script>
```
